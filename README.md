*Disclaimer: This is NOT a Nintendo(R) Related - It is a 
ROBOT project* 
### A project by Jacob Liddy, Ben Hawk, and Mason McCargish

We are going to create two arduino robots: One controlled
by a human and one controlled by a Pi. The Pi robot will 
fight a human controlled robot.

We have not determined what fight means.

The AI robot will use a camera (tentative) and the pi will 
send signals to the arduino.
